"""Own the one way a gate reads its own ``[tool.<name>]`` config out of a pyproject.

Why this exists
---------------
A gate, a tool that checks a tree, usually carries standing config (exclude lists,
allow lists, exempt lists) in a ``[tool.<name>]`` table in the repository's
``pyproject.toml``. Reading it correctly is four separate decisions, and all four
are easy to get subtly wrong in a way no test of the *gate* would notice:

1. **Where to look.** The nearest ``pyproject.toml`` at or above the target path,
   never the process working directory, because the same files otherwise pass from
   one cwd and fail from another.
2. **What absence means.** No pyproject, no table, or no key are all legitimately
   "no config" and must yield an empty list. Absence is not an error.
3. **What malformed means.** A file that will not parse, or a key holding
   something other than a list of strings, must stop the gate. This is the half
   that matters: a reader that treated unparseable config as empty would silently
   shrink the set of things being checked and still print PASS: the exact false
   clean a gate exists to prevent.
4. **What the paths are relative to.** The directory of the pyproject that
   supplied them, so an entry means the same thing regardless of who is asking.

That is a policy, not a snippet, so it is decided once, here.

What it owns, and what it deliberately does not
-----------------------------------------------
It owns path-list keys: given a table name and some key names, it returns each
key's value as resolved :class:`~pathlib.Path` objects. The table name and the key
names are both parameters. There is nothing about any one consumer baked in,
which is the property :func:`read_path_lists`'s tests pin by reading two different
tables out of one document.

It also owns what such an entry means once resolved, which is the half that drifts
most quietly because every tool re-decides it in passing:

* :func:`is_under`: an entry names a subtree, not one path. A tool that
  compared for equality would silently walk into everything below a directory its
  config excluded, and report PASS on files nobody meant to check.
* :func:`dead_paths`: an entry that no longer resolves is stale config that
  gates, unless it was declared prospective. Without that, an allow/exempt list
  keeps excusing folders that no longer exist, so the exclusion outlives the
  reason for it and nothing ever says so.

It does not own:

* **Scalar config.** A boolean marker key is read by whoever cares;
  :func:`read_tool_table` hands back the raw table, values exactly as ``tomllib``
  parsed them, and validating a scalar there is the caller's job. Validating and
  resolving values of every type here would trade the precise path-list contract
  for checks each caller would have to repeat anyway.
* **The consumer's resolved shape.** A gate's own ``Config`` dataclass names its
  keys (``allow`` / ``exempt`` / ``paths``) and stays with that gate. This module
  hands back a plain mapping and takes no view on what the keys mean.

An honestly narrow library beats one that claims to be generic and hardcodes a
table name, so the boundary above is the contract, not an apology for it.

Entry point assumptions
-----------------------
Both filesystem touches are injected (``is_file`` / ``read_text``), so a
consumer's tests can drive every branch, including the unreadable-file one,
without a real tree, and this module performs no I/O of its own. It imports
``tomllib``, so it requires Python 3.11+. It has no other dependency, holds no
state, and cannot fail at import time.
