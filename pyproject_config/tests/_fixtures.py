"""Fixtures shared by more than one of pyproject_config's grouped suites.

Deliberately NOT named ``test_*``: it holds no test cases, and the aggregator's
``discover`` pattern must not try to load it as one. Anything used by a single suite
stays in that suite -- only what genuinely crosses suite boundaries lives here.

Nothing here touches the filesystem. The two seams are the library's injected
``is_file`` / ``read_text`` in their "no file anywhere" form, which is what lets a
case drive the absent-config branch without a real tree: black-box tests must not
reach the host.
